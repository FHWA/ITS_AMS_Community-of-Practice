# Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Analysis, Modeling and Simulation (AMS) Community of Practice 

## Objective
The ITS AMS Community of Practice seeks to connect key ITS stakeholders, AMS stakeholders, and the United States Department of Transportation’s (USDOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to facilitate coordination and communication on the development and use of AMS tools in support of ITS AMS research and development.
This ITS AMS Community Forum hopes to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation among community members by providing a dedicated space for discussing ITS for AMS practices, tools, and applications. Members are encouraged to use the forum as a hub for discussing research initiatives and plans within the membership and the larger transportation community.
